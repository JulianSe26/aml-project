\section{Faster R-CNN}
\sectionauthor{Written by Tobias Richstein}

The Faster R-CNN network architecture proposed in \autocite{ren_faster_2016} by \citeauthor{ren_faster_2016} is an evolutionary step in a line of \acp{R-CNN} which are \acp{CNN} that can perform object detection on images. When given an image, an \ac{R-CNN} is able to predict bounding boxes for detected objects and also classify them. Each predicted bounding box is also given a confidence score that expresses how reliable the model assumes this result is. State of the art Faster \acp{R-CNN} achieve \ac{mAP} scores with a $0.5$ \ac{IoU} threshold of $0.484$ on a reference COCO object detection validation set making it very well suitable for all kinds of detection tasks such as the one at hand. 

The original \ac{R-CNN} was proposed by \citeauthor{girshick_rich_2014} in \autocite{girshick_rich_2014}. This original \ac{R-CNN} consists of three modeules: The first one generates category independent region proposals which are regions in the image that the network believes could have relevant objects in them. In theory \ac{R-CNN} is agnostic to which network performs these region proposals but in the paper a method called \textit{Selective Search} \autocite{uijlings_selective_2013} is used to generate $2000$ region proposals. In the second module the contents of these proposed bounding boxes are passed to a backbone network which in the paper was an \textit{AlexNet} CNN \autocite{krizhevsky_imagenet_2017}, but could be any suitable network architecture to generate a 4096-length feature vector. Then the feature vector is passed onto the third module which is a set of \acp{SVM}, each trained on one specific class, to predict the class of the object encompassed by the bounding box.

The approach described in \autocite{girshick_rich_2014} does work fairly well but has some big drawbacks. First it requires training of the backbone CNN and \ac{SVM} classifiers and then a separate training of the region proposal network, making it very slow to train. Another issue with this architecture was, that inference was very slow with images taking multiple seconds to be processed on a GPU which is most often not sufficient for any sort of time requirements that object detection tasks may have.

To overcome the issues of the original \ac{R-CNN} paper, Fast \ac{R-CNN} was proposed a year later in \autocite{girshick_fast_2015}. Now, instead of passing each proposed region through the CNN separately, the entire image is processed once for which the \ac{CNN} generates a feature map that is valid across all regions. Again using any \ac{CNN} backbone works, but the authors used the then state of the art \textit{VGG16} architecture \autocite{simonyan_very_2015}. While this approach does make the network faster, it still requires an external region proposal network to feed the Fast \ac{R-CNN} with proposals and the image. Some speedup is achieved by being able to train the classifier and bounding box regressor at the same time.

In a third advancement the concept of the Faster \ac{R-CNN} is introduced in \autocite{ren_faster_2016}. The most noticeable change is that the region proposal network is now built in and no longer requires using Selective Search or other methods. After the backbone convolution the feature maps can now be passed onto both the region proposal network and the classifier which means that they share the results of the convolution making the network faster. In the original paper, the authors use the same \textit{VGG16} backbone as in the Fast \ac{R-CNN} paper but note that a larger \textit{ResNet}\autocite{he_deep_2015} model might lead to better results at the cost of more compute intensive training and inference.

The hint that a \textit{ResNet} architecture might be the better backbone to use with a Faster \ac{R-CNN}, led us to research these kinds of networks. After \citeauthor{krizhevsky_imagenet_2017} introduced the widely acclaimed deep \ac{CNN} \textit{AlexNet} a trend started to make these sorts of networks ever deeper, using more and more convolution layers under the assumption that more layers would lead to the detection of finer and maybe more hidden features in images. In \autocite{he_deep_2015} however, \citeauthor{he_deep_2015} show that this assumption only holds to a certain degree and show that a 20 layer network can perform much better than the same network with 56 layers. There are many proposed theories why this might be but the authors focus on fixing it by introducing a so called \textit{Residual Block} which essentially passes the input and output of a layer onto the next layer by adding a shortcut identity mapping from input to output.  Also so called bottlenecks are used which perform a dimensionality reduction with $1 \times 1$ convolutions. In doing so the authors are able to train networks that are hundreds or thousands of layers deep while improving classification metrics with each layer added.

Building upon \textit{ResNet}, \citeauthor{xie_aggregated_2017} propose \textit{ResNeXt} in \autocite{xie_aggregated_2017}. This network architecture introduces the concept of cardinality $C$ where a residual ResNet block is split into $C$ identical groups of operations called paths. ResNeXt networks are described by the number of layers they have, their cardinality and the size of their bottleneck. The larger each parameter is, the more computationally intensive. As a middle ground we picked a model with 101 layers, a cardinality of 32 and a bottleneck size of 8. This is referred to as a \texttt{ResNeXt 101 32x8d}.

\subsection*{Training of the backbone}

First we trained the ResNeXt network to have a performant backbone that the Faster \ac{R-CNN} can utilize. A reference ResNeXt model architecture and implementation can be obtained directly from the makers of PyTorch \autocite{pytorch_team_resnext_nodate}, which we did. This reference implementation has also been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, meaning that we only fine-tune the weights to our use-case. We train the model on the NIH dataset described in section \vref{data:nih} and only expect it to predict the classes of illnesses that can be seen in the X-rays. We encode the ground truths, consisting of the 14 classes of the NIH dataset, as one-hot vectors and therefore also expect output tensors of the same dimension. Like in the original ResNeXt paper, we also use a \acf{SGD} optimizer that has Nesterov acceleration during training. Our learning rate decays over time and follows the equation given below which was originally proposed in \autocite{he_bag_2018} and modified slightly to provide a learning rate floor of $0.05 * \text{lr}_\text{initial}$: 

\begin{align}\label{eq:scheduler}
\text{lr}_t = \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \cos\left(\frac{t * \pi}{T}\right)\right) * 0.95 + 0.05\right) * \text{lr}_\text{initial}
\end{align}

where $t$ is the current learning rate scheduler step and $T$ is the total number of epochs. We take a step every other epoch and start with a learning rate of $\text{lr}_\text{initial} = 0.001$ (see also figure \ref{fig:lr_schedule}).

\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{img/LR.png}
	\caption{Learning rate schedule applied for training the detection models.}
	\label{fig:lr_schedule}
\end{figure*}

As described in the ResNeXt paper we load the images and then perform the augmentations necessary to fit the model requirements. To do so, we use a custom dataloader that provides batches of images together with the one-hot encoded ground truth vectors. The augmentation steps done during dataloading include:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Resize the image to have 256 pixels on the shorter side
	\item Perform a $224 \times 224$ crop in the center of the resized image
	\item Normalize the RGB channels in range $0$ to $1$ to have a mean of $R=0.485; G=0.456; B=0.406$ and a standard deviation of $R=0.229; G=0.224; B=0.225$
\end{itemize}

To prevent overfitting during training we also randomly apply additional augmentations such as horizontal flips ($p=0.5$), random blurs ($p=0.3$), random rotations of up to 20Â° ($p=1$) or random erasing of between 1 and 10 percent of the image area ($p=0.3$).

Since we have somewhat limited hardware resources at our disposal in comparison to large scale compute clusters that are often used for such training tasks by researchers, we also apply a method called \textit{Autocasting} to speed up training and allow us to use larger batch sizes. The basis of Autocasting is the ability to use mixed precision during network training. While most frameworks such as PyTorch usually use 32bit floating point numbers (single precision) for all calculations, it has been shown that performing some operations with 16bit representations (half precision) does not penalize accuracy but provides a large speedup since more data can fit in the most often constrained GPU memory and the also constrained data transfer bandwidth can be used more effectively \autocite{micikevicius_mixed_2018}. The GPUs that we have at our disposal also feature special matrix multiplication hardware that works best with half precision numbers, meaning that we profit from mixed precision training in a significant way. The speedup for the ResNeXt training for example was almost twice as fast as before. The decision whether to perform operations at half precision is made automatically by PyTorch when the model is wrapped in an autocasting decorator.

We train the ResNeXt with a batch size of 32 (like in the original paper) and perform 35 epochs. To calculate the loss we use Binary Cross Entropy but with Logits as recommended for mixed precision training which uses the log-sum-exp trick to improve the numerical stability and avoid loss terms that cannot be represented by half precision \autocite{pytorch_team_automatic_nodate}. The loss numbers for the training and validation loss can be seen in \vref{fig:resnet_loss}. It can be seen that in the end some overfit occurs where the train loss keeps decreasing and the validation loss stays mostly constant or even increases very slightly. In the end we still decided to use the model after 35 epochs since the loss figures are very good and it also evaluates very well as will be shown later in chapter \vref{chapter:eval_resnext}.

\begin{figure*}

	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{img/loss_backbone_rcnn_35.png}
	\caption{Loss figures of the ResNeXt training}
	\label{fig:resnet_loss}
\end{figure*}

\subsection*{Training of the Faster R-CNN}

With the backbone network trained, we could now train the Faster R-CNN on the actual detection task of predicting where lung opacities are located in a patient's X-ray image. This training shares a lot of optimizations with the backbone network described above. We use the same \ac{SGD} optimizer and learning rate schedule and train for 50 epochs which does not take too long due to the limited number of training images. We also again use autocasting since the speed improvements are too good to leave out.

Due to the limited number of samples available in the SIIM dataset, we now augment the images more extensively to further prevent overfitting. Because we now have bounding boxes in the aforementioned (?) COCO format we also have to apply all augmentations to those too. To also allow the network to better detect small opacities and details we now train with a much larger image size of $512 \times 512$. We also perform random horizontal flips ($p=0.3$), random shifts with rotations of maximum 20Â° ($p=0.3$), one of random sharpen ($p=0.5$) or blur ($p=0.25$), random brightness and contrast adjustments ($p=0.3$) and random circular cutouts (max. 6; $p=0.3$). During inference however we pass the inputs as $1024 \times 1024$ images to make the results even clearer. As with the backbone net, we also adjust the RGB channels to fit the required mean and standard deviation values.

Due to the much larger input images and network size we can only train the Faster R-CNN with a batch size of 10 and perform validation with a batch size of 6. During training of a Faster R-CNN multiple loss values have to be taken into account since there are the two tasks of classification and bounding box prediction. Detailed loss figures can be seen in figure \vref{fig:rcnn_loss}. As will be evidenced later in chapter \vref{chapter:eval_rcnn_yolo} after 50 epochs there was already some overfit even though the loss numbers look promising.

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{img/loss_fasterrcnn_50.png}
	\caption{Loss figures of the Faster R-CNN training}
	\label{fig:rcnn_loss}
\end{figure*}

Per default a Fast(er) R-CNN uses a smooth L1 loss for the box regression as described in \autocite{girshick_fast_2015} which according to the authors prevents exploding gradients unlike loss functions proposed in earlier R-CNN revisions. However, to try and improve convergence speeds and model accuracy, we also implemented a \ac{CIoU} loss, proposed in \autocite{zheng_enhancing_2021} and described in more detail in section \vref{chapter:yolo}, for the regressor. Unfortunately this did not work at all and the model converged a lot slower than anticipated and sometimes even became a lot worse over time. The reasons for this would need to be investigated further but due to time constraints we had to revert back to using the default smooth L1 loss function which in the end also proved quite capable as will be shown later in the evaluation in section \vref{chapter:eval_rcnn_yolo}.

\section{YOLO}\label{chapter:yolo}
\sectionauthor{Written by Julian Seibel}

The \acl{YOLO} (\ac{YOLO}) model originally proposed in \autocite{yoloOriginal} is an object detector introduced in 2015 by \citeauthor{yoloOriginal}. In contrast to the previous presented Faster \ac{R-CNN}, this model makes its predictions with just a single network evaluation and is therefore called a single-shot detector (hence the name \ac{YOLO}). Unlike in region proposal or sliding window based network architectures, \ac{YOLO} considers the entire image
for predicting which enables the model to implicitly encode context information about the objects. With this, the model is capable of learning the typical shape and size of objects, which objects are likely to occur together and what typical positions objects have in relation to other objects. The initial idea was to provide a object detection network that achieves both, high quality and high inference speed. The authors claim that their \ac{YOLO} model can be up to 1000 times faster than \ac{R-CNN} and up to 100 times faster than Faster \ac{R-CNN}.
Since its initial introduction, the \ac{YOLO} model was adapted in many research problems and has been improved in several follow-up works \autocite{yolov2} \autocite{yolov3} to finally come up with the newest version \textit{V4} \autocite{yolov4}.
In general, a \ac{YOLO} model consist of three main pieces:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The backbone, similar to the Faster \ac{R-CNN}, this is a deep \ac{CNN} that learns image features at different angularities. In their original paper, the authors used a backbone named \textit{Darknet} that is a neural network consisting of 53 convolution
	layers \autocite{yolov3}. However this was substituted with a CSPNet \autocite{wang2020cspnet} since \textit{V4} \autocite{yolov4}.
	\item The neck, that is a series of layers which combine features of different convolution layers. Since \textit{V4} the PANet \autocite{tan2020efficientdet} neck is used for this part of the model. 
	\item The head, that part consumes the features from the neck and processes them further for the final box, confidence and class prediction.
\end{itemize}
The \ac{YOLO} model divides each input image of size $512\times512$ into a $G\times G$ grid, where a grid cell is \enquote{responsible} for an object if it contains the objects' center point. Each grid cell predicts bounding boxes using predefined anchors and corresponding confidence scores that indicate how likely it is that the box contains an object and how well the box fits to the object. For each bounding box a confidence score is predicted using logistic regression. Unlike in \ac{R-CNN}, the \ac{YOLO} model does not predict an offset coordinates for predefined anchors, it rather predicts the location coordinates relative to the center of a grid cell which constraints the coordinates to fall between 0 and 1. This helps the network to learn the parameters more easy. Therefore, the model prediction for a bounding box is a quintuple $(t_x,t_y,t_w,t_h,c)$ consisting of four coordinates and one for the object confidence (also called \enquote{objectness}), where $t_x$ and $t_y$ are the normalized center coordinates of the bounding box. As illustrated in figure \ref{fig:yolo_box}, the model predicts the width and height of the bounding box as offsets from center coordinates of the box and anchors given the offset from the grid cell to the top left image corner ($c_x$,$c_y$) and the anchor width and height ($p_w$,$p_h$) \autocite{yolov2} \autocite{yolov3}.
\begin{figure*}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{img/boxpred.png}
	\caption{\ac{YOLO} box prediction extracted from \autocite{yolov3}.}
	\label{fig:yolo_box}
\end{figure*}
For each predicted box a class label is assigned using a sigmoid based multi-label classification. The confidence score for a object is then the product of \enquote{objectness} and class confidence to express the probability of a certain class instance appearing in the predicted bounding box and the quality of how well the box fits the object.
The model will produce outputs at different scales and depending on the number of anchors, for each grid cell multiple bounding boxes will be predicted. This often leads to a huge number of predictions per image, which is why non maximum suppression is performed  to filter out boxes that do not meet a certain confidence threshold and that overlap to much in terms of \ac{IoU} (used thrshold of 0.5 in our experiments).


\subsection*{Training of the \ac{YOLO} model}
For our implementation, we decided to use a model provided by \autocite{yolov5} which is called unofficially YOLO \textit{V5} which is based on the YOLO \textit{V4} with some improvements in speed and quality. For our model configuration we used the \textit{yolov5l} model from \autocite{yolov5}.

Similar to \autocite{CoronaDLTransfer} and  \autocite{mangal2020covidaid}, we found that there are not enough data available to achieve state-of-the-art results which is why we use a transfer-learning approach with pretrained weights on the COCO dataset, leading to a performance boost in terms of our selected metrics (see \vref{chapter:eval_rcnn_yolo} for further details). Furthermore, we did a second pretraining step, where we used the RSNA pneumonia detection dataset described in \vref{data:rsna}, to adjust the initial COCO-weights in the direction of medical lung images by training the model for 40 epochs. Despite that the objective is different (detecting pneumonia instead of COVID-19), both datasets share many things like the prediction of just one class called \textit{opacity}. We could see an increased performance in the evaluation if we do such a pretraining. The final model is then ultimately trained for 30 epochs on the SIIM COVID-19 data.

As already mentioned in the Faster \ac{R-CNN} training, we did several experiments implementing alternative regression losses for the bounding box predictions. In the \ac{YOLO} paper the authors use a \ac{MSE} regression loss to train the bounding box output. However, as \citeauthor{giou} \autocite{giou} report in their work, there is not a strong correlation between minimizing the \ac{MSE} and improving the \ac{IoU} value. In addition the authors concern that the evaluation of the model is mostly done using \ac{IoU}-based metrics whereas the training is performed by minimizing a \ac{MSE} loss.

Instead, the authors proposed to use a more appropriate loss they call \ac{GIoU} loss. There exist several extensions like the previously described \ac{CIoU} loss \autocite{zheng_enhancing_2021} or \ac{DIoU} loss \autocite{DIoU}.
The objectness and class confidence predictions were trained using a Binary Cross Entropy with Logits loss. The final loss is then a weighted sum of all the three single losses:
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{L}_{total} = 0.1 * \mathcal{L}_{box} + 0.5 * \mathcal{L}_{class} + 1.0 * \mathcal{L}_{objectness}
\end{align} 

For the training process, we used a similar setup like in the Faster \ac{R-CNN} training including a \ac{SGD}-based optimizer with a start learning rate of $lr_{initial} = 0.01$, a learning rate scheduling as described in \ref{eq:scheduler} and an input image size of $512 \times 512$. Because of VRAM constrains in our hardware, we could only use a batch size of 3 but we used a gradient accumulation based on a nominal batch size of 64.
 
Similar to the Faster \ac{R-CNN} we applied several image transformations as augmentation technique, that include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1. Augmentation
	\item 2. Augmentation
\end{itemize}

The losses for the pretraining and actual COVID-19 training are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:yolo_losses}. For the pretraining, we can see a slight increase of the validation loss after about 25 epochs. This may be caused by overfitting. On the other hand the loss for the actual training has some strange pattern: The validation loss is always smaller than the train loss, which may be caused by one of the following facts:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item validation set to small
	\item regularization/dropout which is not active during validation
	\item validation loss is measured after each epoch, whereas train loss is measured during epochs, which means that there is a shift in model performance.
	\item Data augmentation during training
\end{enumerate}

\section{Combining detections}
\sectionauthor{Julian Seibel}
For our final COVID-19 detection, we decided to combine the two described models in an ensemble predictor to combine both advantages of the models and also to create a more stable bounding-box prediction considering both the outputs. For this we created a weighted box fusion following the approach of \citeauthor{weightedBoxFusion} \autocite{weightedBoxFusion}, where we get a final bounding box prediction given the predictions of each model.

Each predicted box is added to a list $B$, that is sorted w.r.t. the corresponding confidence scores. Then two new empty lists are created for boxes clusters $L$ and fused boxes $F$. Each position in $F$ stores the fused box for the corresponding entry $pos$ in $L$. The algorithm then iterates over the predicted boxes in $B$ trying to find a matching box in $F$ based on a \ac{IoU} criteria (e.g. IoU > Threshold, where in our case the threshold was set to 0.55). If no match is found, the box from list $B$ is added $L$ and $F$. In contrast, if a match is found, the box is added to the cluster list $L$ at the corresponding position to the box in $F$. The box coordinates $(x,y)$ and confidence scores $c$ in $F$ will then be recalculated using all boxes accumulated in $L[pos]$ with the fusion equation:
\begin{align}
	c = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T}c_i}{T}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	x_{1,2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T} c_i * x_{1,2}^i}{\sum_{i=1}^{T} c_i}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
	y_{1,2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{T} c_i * y_{1,2}^i}{\sum_{i=1}^{T} c_i}
\end{align}
Using the confidence scores as weights, predicted boxes with higher confidence naturally contribute more to the fused box.
If all predicted boxes in $B$ are processed, confidence scores in $F$ will be rescaled using the number of predicted bounding boxes $T$ and and the number of participating models $M$:
\begin{align}
	c = c * \frac{min(T,M)}{M}
\end{align}
In our final version, we set the weights for the box fusion $w_{fusion} = (1,1)$ meaning that each model contributes the same to the final prediction.
As fusion-criteria we set an \ac{IoU}-threshold for both predictions to $IoU_{fusion} = 0.55$ which was also the best experienced parameter value described in the original paper \autocite{weightedBoxFusion}.
We did not apply any training process to the ensemble model, but it would be interesting to train the ensemble approach in an end to end fashion. However, we do not have the computational resources available to jointly train both detection models.
