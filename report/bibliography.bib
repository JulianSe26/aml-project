	title = {Faster R-{CNN}: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks},
	shorttitle = {Faster R-{CNN}},
	abstract = {State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like {SPPnet} and Fast R-{CNN} have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network ({RPN}) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An {RPN} is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The {RPN} is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-{CNN} for detection. We further merge {RPN} and Fast R-{CNN} into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the {RPN} component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep {VGG}-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a {GPU}, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on {PASCAL} {VOC} 2007, 2012, and {MS} {COCO} datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In {ILSVRC} and {COCO} 2015 competitions, Faster R-{CNN} and {RPN} are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},
